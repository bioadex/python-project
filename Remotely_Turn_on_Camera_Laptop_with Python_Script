Firstly to need to ssh into laptop windows 

You can find the steps on how to do that in my github page 

After you successful ssh into your windows laptop 

Python on Windows to remotely turn on your laptop camera 

download python3 from python official website : https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/

During install, check ✅ “Add to PATH”.  # note the path where Python3 is installed 

Open in PowerShell in Administrative mode 

then install the packages:

pip install opencv-python flask

After the installation 

Create the python streaming script 

Create a file C:\cam_stream.py with this code:   # make sure that this is save under C drive 

import cv2
from flask import Flask, Response

app = Flask(__name__)
camera = cv2.VideoCapture(0)  # 0 = default webcam

def generate_frames():
    while True:
        success, frame = camera.read()
        if not success:
            break
        else:
            # Encode the frame as JPEG
            ret, buffer = cv2.imencode('.jpg', frame)
            frame = buffer.tobytes()
            # Stream it as multipart response
            yield (b'--frame\r\n'
                   b'Content-Type: image/jpeg\r\n\r\n' + frame + b'\r\n')

@app.route('/video')
def video():
    """Video streaming route. Go to /video to see the feed."""
    return Response(generate_frames(),
                    mimetype='multipart/x-mixed-replace; boundary=frame')

@app.route('/favicon.ico')
def favicon():
    """Prevent browser 404 favicon requests."""
    return '', 204  # No content, but prevents 404 log spam

if __name__ == '__main__':
    # host=0.0.0.0 makes it accessible on your LAN
    app.run(host='0.0.0.0', port=5000, debug=False)


copy the script then save the file in C drive as cam_stream.py 

ssh into your windows laptop 

ssh your_windows_user@windows_ip "python C:/cam_stream.py"        # this is will start the python script 

view the live stream from any broswer connected to your LAN
